# PHP: Unhandled Missing Key in Data Processing

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP data processing: failing to handle cases where an expected key is missing from an array.  The `processData` function attempts to access the 'value' key of each array element. If this key is absent, the function produces unexpected behavior (in this case, a Notice or Warning). This example shows how to prevent this by adding a default value.
